# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

Welcome to my OOP repository. This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my progress, focusing on the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming using C++. 



## 📌 About This Repository
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate a mastery of OOP concepts, starting from basic class structures to complex design patterns. Each module focuses on creating clean, reusable, and efficient code.

## 🛠 Core Technical Concepts
As this repository evolves, it will cover:
* **Encapsulation**: Using access specifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`) to bundle data and methods while restricting direct access.
* **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
* **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reusability.
* **Polymorphism**: allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class through function overloading and virtual functions.
* **Operator Overloading**: Redefining standard operators to work with user-defined types.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by modules/topics. Each directory contains specific implementations and logic:

* **Basic Class Design**: Date handling, employee records, and metadata management.
* **Data Management**: Inventory systems using STL containers like `std::vector`.
* **Mathematical Modeling**: Polynomial calculations and operator overloading.
* **State Simulations**: Behavioral logic for real-world objects (e.g., Glass/Liquid tracking).

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`, `clang`, or `msvc`).

### 2. Compilation
To compile any specific `.cpp` file, use:
```bash
g++ FileName.cpp -o OutputName
