COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

To compile any file:

g++ filename.cpp -o output_name

Example:
g++ deep-vs-shallow-copy-constructor.cpp -o copy_test
./copy_test

With C++11 standard:
g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp -o output_name

With warnings:
g++ -Wall filename.cpp -o output_name
