   - Important logic sections

EXAMPLE: Before and After
==========================

BEFORE (task1.cpp):
-------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class CrystalPair
{
private:
    int *power;
    string name;
    string mode;


AFTER (deep-vs-shallow-copy-constructor.cpp):
----------------------------------------------
/*
 * Program: Deep vs Shallow Copy Constructor
 * 
 * Description:
 * This program demonstrates deep vs shallow copy constructor.
 * 
 * Key Concepts Covered:
 * - Copy Constructor
 * - Deep Copy
 * - Shallow Copy
 * - Dynamic Memory
 * - Memory Management
 *
 * Author: IBA Karachi - OOP Course
 * Instructor: Sir Behraj Khan
